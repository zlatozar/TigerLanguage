## Tiger Language in F#

This project contains Tiger language implementation described in book <br/>
_"Modern Compiler Implementation in ML" (1998) by Andrew Appel_

The main ideas behind every step during development are:

- control constraints and give feedback (lexer, parser and syntactic analysis)
- simplification of computation (intermediate language)
- efficiency/optimization (the whole compiler backend)
