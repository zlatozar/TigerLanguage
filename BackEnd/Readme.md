### Used MIPS Instructions

At the machine language level there are no explic it data types, only contents of memory
locations. The concept of type is present only implicitly in how data is used.

See _MipsCodegen.fs_

**MIPS Addresses**

The MIPS instruction that loads a word into a register is the `lw` instruction. The store
word instruction is `sw`. Each must specify a _register_ and a _memory_ _address_. A MIPS
instruction is 32 bits (always). A MIPS memory address is 32 bits (always). How can a load
or store instruction specify an address that is the same size as itself?

An instruction that refers to memory uses a **base register** and an **offset**. The base
register is a general purpose register that contains a 32-bit address. The offset is a
16-bit signed integer contained in the instruction. _The sum of the address in the base_
_register with the (sign-extended) offset forms the memory address_

**Pseudoinstructions**

In short this instruction is provided by assembler not from processor!

The `addu` instruction, used as above with register `$zero`, copies a bit pattern from the
source register into the destination register. This is usually called a _move operation_,
although the source register does not change. It is often convenient to _move_ a value
from one register to another.

It is awkward to say `add` when you mean `move`. The **extended assembler** allows you to
use the mnemonic `move` instead of `addu`. **This mnemonic does not correspond to a new
machine instruction.** It is just a way of asking for the same instruction by using a more
intuitive mnemonic. It is a pseudoinstruction that the **assembler** translates into the
appropriate **basic** assembly instruction.

_A pseudoinstruction is an instruction that the extended assembler replaces with one or_
_more basic assembly instructions._

```assembly
lw  dset, offset(base)  # offset is optional
```

**Immediate Instruction**

A computer program instruction, part of which contains a constant (**immediate value**)
to be operated upon, rather than the address of that data. Immediate values are typically
used in instructions that load a value or performs an arithmetic or a logical operation
on a constant. Example:

```assembly
add  rd, rs, rt
addi  rt, rs, imm
```

**Notes**
- All integers are in **2â€™s complement** representation if not indicated as _unsigned_.
- Unsigned values range from `0` to `255` (store larger numbers)
- Signed values range from `-128` to `127`
- In `C` cannot overflow an unsigned integer
- Operand order is fixed - destination first: <opcode>  <destination>, <left operand>, <right operand>
- Can refer to registers by name (e.g., `$s2`, `$t2`)

**Legend**

`rd` - register destination (store result)
`rs` - register that contains first operatnd
`rs` - register for the second operand
`imm` - immediate value

#### Assembly Directives

`.data`  Mark beginning of a data segment.

`.word size`  In `.word` data is stored in the form of 32 bits. It can also
              be used to initialize array.

`.ascii str`  Declare and initialize a string. `.ascii "Hello word"` for example

#### Data Movement Instructions

`move  rdest, rsrc`  _pseudoinstruction_

#### Store Instructions

`sw  reg, address`  Store the word from register _reg_ at _address_. See `lw`.
                    `sw  reg, 1000(base)` means _Memory[base+1000]=reg_

#### Jump Instructins

`jal  label`  Unconditionally jump to the instruction at label. Save the address of the next
              instruction in register `$ra`. Use when making procedure call because it saves the
              return address in `$ra`. Here is how you can interpret `jal  1000`:
                 **$ra=PC+4; go to address 1000**

`j  label`  Unconditionally jump to the instruction at label. Go to the `label`(address)

`jr  reg`  Unconditionally jump to the instruction whose address is in register `reg`. Use for switch
           or procedure return (`jr RA` # PC = $ra)

#### Branch Instructions

`bne  rs, rt, label`  Test if registers `rs` and `rt` are **not** equal.
                      `bne  rs, rt, 1000` means _if(rs != rt); go to PC+4+1000_

`blt  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on less than.
                      `blt  rs, rt, 1000` means _if(rs < rt); go to PC+4+1000_

`bgt  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on greater than.
                      `bgt  rs, rt, 1000` means _if(rs > rt); go to PC+4+1000_

`ble  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on less than or equal.
                      `ble  rs, rt, 1000` means _if(rs <= rt); go to PC+4+1000_

`bge  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on greater than or equal.
                      `bge  rs, rt, 1000` means _if(rs >= rt); go to PC+4+1000_

Not used in current implementation

`bltu  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on less than **unsigned**.

`bleu  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on less than or equal **unsigned**.

`bgtu  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on greater than **unsigned**.

`bgeu  rs, rt, label`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Branch on greater than or equal **unsigned**.

#### Load Instructions

`lw  rdest, address`  Copy from memory to register. See `sw`.
                      `lw  rdest, 1000(base)` means _rdest = Memory[base+1000]_

`li  rdest, imm`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Move the constant `imm` into register `rdest`.

`la  rdest, address`  (_pseudoinstruction_) Loads computed address of label (not its contents)
                      into register `rdest`.
                      `la  rdest, label` means _rdest = Address of the label_

#### Arithmetic and Logical Instructions

Remember arithmetic operands are registers or immediates, not memory!

`addi  rd, rs, imm`  `addi  rd, rs, 1000` means _rd = rs + 1000_

`add  rd, rs, rt`  means _rd = rs + rt_

`sub  rd, rs, rt`  means _rd = rs - rt_

`mulo  rdest, rsrc1, src2`  (__pseudoinstruction_) Multiplay `rsrc1` with `src2` and store
                            result in `rdest`. Signal overflow.

`div  rs, rt`  (__pseudoinstruction_) Divide register `rs` by register `rt`.
               Leave the quotient in register `lo` and the remainder in register `hi`.
               `hi, lo = rs/rt`.

### Example code

#### Labels

A label may refer to the location of a data value (variable) or of an instruction.

```assembly
       .data
N:     .word 10

       .text

main:
       lw  $t0, N      # $t0 <-- Mem[N] (10)
       la  $t1, N      # $t1 <-- N      (address)
       ...
exit:  li  $v0, 10
```

#### Loop

```C
int Sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    Sum = Sum + i
}
```

```assembly
# $s0 == Sum, $s1 == N, $t0 == i
      move  $s0, $zero     # register assignment
      lw  $s1, N           # assume global symbol
      li  $t0, 1           # literal assignment

loop: beq   $t0, $s1, done   # loop test
      add   $s0, $s0, $t0    # Sum = Sum + i
      addi  $t0, $t0, 1      # ++i
      b     loop             # restart loop
done:
```

#### Arrays

```assembly
      .data
list: .word 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 # ten elements

size: .word 10  # array size (not used but could be)

.....
     la  $t1, list   # get array address
     li  $t2, 0      # set loop counter

print_loop:
            beq  $t2, $t3, print_loop_end   # check for array end
            lw  $a0, ($t1)                  # print value at the array pointer
            li  $v0, 1
            syscall
            addi  $t2, $t2, 1               # advance loop counter
            addi  $t1, $t1, 4               # advance array pointer

            j  print_loop                   # repeat the loop

print_loop_end:
```
